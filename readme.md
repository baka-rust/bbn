# Sam's Bits, Bytes, and Nibbles (bbn) #

## About ##
**bbn** is a very simple blog I'm writing in python with mod_wsgi for apache (using bottle for my microframework).

It uses Jinja2 for templating and dataset with MySQL for database interactions.

It allows for posting, has a tag system, and grabs updates from my github and tumblr via RSS feeds (and maybe more things via RESTful APIs).
